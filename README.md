The number keys are types of functions, 0 is f(x)=y^2, etc.,
The arrow keys control the movement of the function, you'll figure that out pretty fast
A and Q are the speed at which the function moves or stretchs/compresses
W and S control the stretching/compressing
when done, press B or set the B slider to >0 and press the enter button on the far right and it will print an equation
